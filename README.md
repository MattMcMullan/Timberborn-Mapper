# Timberborn-Mapper
A tool for turning height maps into Timberborn maps.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GinFuyou/Timberborn-Mapper/gins_refactor/assets/TimberbornMapper-680.jpeg)
> Screen cap is taken using QuadrupleTerrainHeight mod using 48 layers, vanilla game supports less.

# Setup
1. Install python. You can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install pillow. You can read their instructions [here](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html), or just open your command prompt and run "python -m pip install pillow".
3. Click the green "Code" button in github for directions to download this code.

## Windows binary
Windows users can try script packaged as single executable file from [dist directory](dist/).
No dependencies or setup required.
Copy `examples/` dir to try suggested commands.

## Alternatively (for advanced python users)
Using poetry

1. Clone repository
2. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
3. `poetry install` will install all dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and manages virtual environment
4. `poetry shell` activates virtual environment for the project

Currently project requires python 3.10 or 3.11 but may work on other versions.

# Usage

**Note**: at the moment tree map will generate only birches, other trees need fixing yield attributes.

- script expects a grayscale image as height map (most likely a PNG but some other formats should also work)
- check help for available options, like setting map size, output file name and script behaviour modifiers

## Script version
- Open the command prompt and cd to the directory with the code.
- Run `python mapper --help` to see instructions on how to use it.

## Binary version (Windows)
- Open command promt (or powershell) and `cd` ("change directory" command) to the folder with executable.
- Run `TimberbornMapper.exe --help` to see instructions on how to use it.

You can also just drag-n-drop height map image or spec file onto executable's icon or it's links. But can't set options directly this way.
It will output **.timber** file into same place where input file was taken.

## Configuration files

**Note**: Script is using `tomllib` for config format, so it will work only on python **3.11+** (Windows binary uses 3.11).

If configuration is available script will try to write a template config into system-specific config dir.

If file already exists it will try to read it. Command-line arguments should override config values when set.


## Getting height maps

There are likely a number of services where you can get a height map of real or fictional location.

One I've used so far is https://heightmap.skydark.pl/
- It has map size slider limited to 17 km, but you can input it down to 9 km (lesser doesn't work for me for some reason).
- Select desired area and click "Download PNG height map".
- If picture lacks contrast play with "Height scale" input slider.

# TODO

1. ~~Make a Windows binary for players who don't care for python, pip or java alternately.~~
2. More interactivity.
3. More validation and better error handling.
4. Document some example method where and how you can get height map image of real-world location.
5. ~~Try to automatically save to /Documents/Timberborn/Maps/ on Windows.~~
6. Implement configurations (WIP).
7. Disable colors by env vars.
8. ~~Fix plant Yields.~~
9. ~~Add chestnut trees.~~
